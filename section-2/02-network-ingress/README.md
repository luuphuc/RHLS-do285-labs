# Exposing Applications for External Access

## Objective
In this lab, you will expose an application secured by TLS certificates.

## Outcomes
You should be able to:
- Deploy an application and create an unencrypted route for it.
- Create an OpenShift edge route with encryption.
- Update an OpenShift deployment to support a new version of the application.
- Create an OpenShift TLS secret and mount it to your application.
- Verify that the communication to the application is encrypted
